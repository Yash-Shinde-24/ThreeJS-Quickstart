# ThreeJS-Quickstart
Welcome to my Three.js project! This project demonstrates how to set up a basic 3D scene using Three.js, featuring the stunning Apple Vision Pro model. The goal is to provide a simple example of loading a 3D model, incorporating lighting, and adding interactive controls to explore the model in 3D space.
